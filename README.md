# SSHDog

SSHDog is your go-anywhere lightweight SSH server.  Written in Go, it aims
to be a portable SSH server that you can drop on a system and use for remote
access without any additional configuration.

Useful for:

* Tech support
* Backup SSHD
* Authenticated remote bind shells

At this time it only supports shells and port forwarding and only public key authentication
is supported.
